# Basic-data-analysis-with-Covid-19

You can either use the file I uploaded here (Not recommended) or you get the current dataset from: https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data (Strongly recommended).
This analysis reads a .csv file. If you download data with any other file extension, make sure you adjust pd.read_csv in the second cell accordingly.

The dataset from the URL above gets updated daily. The one I uploaded here doesn't.
